 Association Management in C# Layered Architecture. This project is developed as a term project for our Visual Programming course.
As our associate professor required us to start from scratch and rewrite everything, we were mandated to use Access Database and older ADO.NET and its driver codes instead of .NET Framework or .NET Core and SQL Server. The reason is that Microsoft Access DB can be embedded within the project, enabling mobility.

After providing the necessary information, I am sharing the project report and codes to ensure future students don't face the same challenges I did and to contribute to open source. You can download the project and log in using 11111111111 as the username and 123456 as the password.
